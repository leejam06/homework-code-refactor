# homework-code-refactor

This was the criteria that was provided for this homework assignment. 

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I worked on changing the HTML to be more accessible, added some more detail and information rather than having generic tags. I worked on developing a CSS style that would make the layout more uniform and easier to see. I added the footer to the bottom of the page as well.
